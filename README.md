Hi, Iâ€™m @NewbieProgrammer-Taylor
Im a high school student, Living a mediocre life, my family is just surviving not living ourselves to the fullest life has been quite empty. I want to change myself
I wanna get rich, enough to retire my whole family. I want to see them living their dreams...
In my life i have dreamt on getting rich quickly, live extravagantly, but thats it, Its just a dream... But i found out Programming a future proof skill and have seen many succesful people and was inspired, 
I came here to seek guidance from all, I may be average in every way but one thing i can do is exert hard work.
